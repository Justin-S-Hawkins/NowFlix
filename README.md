 🎬 NowFlix

Hi! Welcome to NowFlix! This is a personal project I’ve been building to improve my understanding of working with APIs and writing cleaner, more reusable code. I’m currently refactoring several functions to make my modals more modular and scalable, reduce code repetition, and improve maintainability.
I’m self-taught, and I’d love any feedback or advice from real developers — especially around writing DRY, professional-quality JavaScript. If you have any tips, please reach out on Discord: @justinhawkins_. Thanks for taking the time to check it out!
